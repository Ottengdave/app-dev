My first respository
**X-men**
**X-Men is an American superhero film series based on the Marvel Comics superhero team of the same name. 20th Century Fox obtained the film rights to the team and other related characters in 1994 for $2,600,000.**

**Right outta the way outta the bat I gotta give a bunch of honourable mentions. Really, I could never choose, so many X-Men are my favourite. Nightcrawler is up there, Kitty Pryde is up there, Storm is up there. Magneto is probably my favourite mutant, but I like him better when he's not an X-Man. I love Rogue and Jean and Angel and the whole O.G. 5 really, and Magik and Dani Moonstar and Rachel Summers and Jubilee and of course the Prof himself.**


**But gun to my head, if I had to pick one? It's Cyclops all day long. Purely in terms of the simple but brilliant premise that makes a great and memorable superhero, he personifies to me everything that makes the X-Men great as a concept. Laser vision is one of the all time classic superpowers, it's a thing heroes have been doing since the birth of the genre, it's a thing every kid has imagined having.**

**And Stan Lee just went 'but what if you couldn't turn it off?' And suddenly this schlocky fantastical power fantasy becomes a real world problem that has an affect on a character's life and is, in reality, a huge burden and way more trouble than it's worth. That, in my opinion, is the pure brilliant lightning in a bottle of the X-Men, and really that whole initial boom of 60's Marvel characters, in a nutshell.**

**THEN you add the fact that ol' Slim Summers himself becomes a really interesting character over the years, this poor traumatized kid who was so grateful to Xavier for saving him from a life in a cage that he devoted his entire existence to being the perfect soldier, and it horribly warps him, and he goes through all this horrible shit and discovers himself for the first time after Jean dies, and then all the other X-Men are so shitty to him after AvX even tho HE WAS FUCKING RIGHT and man, I could just go on and on. I am a Scottoholic. They should make him Captain America**
